Twitter can be a great way to get news and information or to promote yourself or a product. We start with creating a twitter profile and from there learn all the main features of Twitter. We utilize Twitter.com, the Twitter for Mac App and and the Twitter for iOS App to show you the differences on each platform and device. Learn to use hashtags, likes, tweet photos, retweet, understand various notifications and much more! \n\nCourse Contents...\n\n\t1.\tIntroduction\n\t2.\tWhat is Twitter?\n\t3.\tCreating a Twitter Profile\n\t4.\tFind others to Follow\n\t5.\tPosting a Tweet\n\t6.\tInsert a Link\n\t7.\tAdd Photos and Videos\n\t8.\tTake & Edit a Photo\n\t9.\tGIFs & Polls\n\t10.\tTag a Location or People\n\t11.\tSearch\n\t12.\tHashtags\n\t13.\tRetweets\n\t14.\tLikes\n\t15.\tReplies & Mentions\n\t16.\tDirect Messages\n\t17.\tNotifications\n\t18.\tUnfollow, Block & Mute\n\t19.\tMoments\n\t20.\tLists\n\t21.\tMultiple Accounts\n\t22.\tWrap Up",

			"description": "RulingScreen makes you rule your screen. A simple, easy-to-use ruler that lets you develop and design your app easier.\n\nYou can register a shortcut to show/hide your ruler, pretty easily.\n\nYou can also enjoy various features, such as moving ruler to suit your needs, changing the color of the ruler, or show the ruler always on top of the screen.\n\nI originally decided to develop it after I found that it is too painful to measure a window size of various apps on the screen. I wished I got a good ruler to make my OS X app development life more fruitful.\n\nIf you feel sympathy for it, you might get to like the app.\n\nThank you for the support, guys!",
