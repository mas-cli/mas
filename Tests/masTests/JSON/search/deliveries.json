			"description": "Deliveries helps you keep track of all your packages, so you always know when they’re going to arrive. Whether it's the latest gadget you've preordered online, or a new graphic novel you can't wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you don't miss the doorbell.\n\nThe main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping company’s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to.\n\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.) If you have packages from other services, just select “Other” and enter a delivery date and web site—so you can check on them when you need to and still keep everything in one place.\n\nDeliveries is also available for iOS, in a Universal app that supports iPhone and iPad. You can sync your deliveries between devices with iCloud or our own Junecloud sync. If you create a Junecloud account, you can add new shipments from any web browser.\n\nHave any questions? Just visit junecloud.com/sync and click Help.",

			"description": "Questionmark Secure is a lock-down browser that people (candidates) use to take online tests and exams. Questionmark Secure, is used in conjunction with an organization’s Questionmark OnDemand service or Questionmark Perception on-premise software to help candidates focus on using their own cognition to answer questions and prevents them from accessing other applications during the exam.\n \nQuestionmark OnDemand/Perception and Questionmark Secure are designed to work together to provide a secure environment for online exams that reduces the risk of cheating and complements an organization’s other defenses for mitigating threats to content security and results integrity.\n \nAcademic institutions, businesses and governmental organizations use Questionmark’s technologies to create, deliver and report on online tests and exams.  These online assessments may be delivered via a standard browser, such as Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.  However, certain high-stakes tests and exams warrant the additional protections provided by Questionmark Secure, including:  preventing the copying or printing exam material; accidentally exiting a test; and gaining access to materials (either locally or Internet-based) that could give an unfair advantage. Questionmark Secure delivers online assessment content while disabling key system functions such as task-switching, right click options, screen captures, menus, printing and other functions that might jeopardize the fair and secure completion of the assessment.\n \nFor more information, visit the Questionmark website at http://www.questionmark.com/secure/",

			"description": "Introducing iPostMaster - the friendly, easy-to-use, and helpful app designed to serve as a hub for all your incoming and outgoing deliveries, parcels, and more! \n\nDESIGN\n\niPostMaster was designed to be as friendly, easy-to-use, and as appealing to the eye as possible. Engineered and created using Apple’s incredible SwiftUI framework, iPostMaster utilises a gorgeous minimalistic user interface consisting of simple and easy-to-view colours. Accessibility is a must and utilises Dynamic Type, Smart Invert, and more.\n\nCreating an interface without any clutter that feels instantly natural to everyone was a priority in the core design of iPostMaster, and the app truly delivers on this desire. Whether you are a first-time user, or an app-master, iPostMaster will feel unbelievably natural every time you open it.\n\nSUPPORTED COURIERS\n\niPostMaster supports over 80 of the biggest international carriers across the UK, Europe, the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, including, but certainly not limited to, Apple, Royal Mail, ParcelForce, UPS, Hermes, DHL, An Post, USPS, and many more.\n\nOrder a new MacBook Pro? Or a new iPhone? Or new AirPods? You can even track your order from the Apple Online Store in iPostMaster!\n\nAlongside this, if you have a tracking number from a courier not supported by iPostMaster, you can use the ‘Other’ option, which still allows you to store your tracking numbers within the app and add an ETA so you’ll get a notification when it is scheduled to arrive!\n\nPRIVACY\n\nPrivacy was perhaps the most central concept in the creation of iPostMaster. It was designed to keep your privacy intact, and all information is stored on device, and is not (and never will be) uploaded, sold, collected, or otherwise shared with anyone. \n\nThere is nothing in the app that will compromise your security. I designed this app so that all users could feel confident using iPostMaster and know that their information will be safe.\n\nWhen you use the ‘Track’ feature and you are navigated to a courier’s website, your privacy still remains intact. The URL is opened through Apple’s highly-secure web browser, Safari, inside iPostMaster. Your data, tracking numbers, and anything else on the app is not, and never will be, shared with any of the couriers. It should be noted that when you go to a couriers website, you are consenting to their Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. We are not responsible for these couriers or their practices.\n\nWORKS ACROSS ALL YOUR DEVICES\n\niPostMaster stores your tracking numbers in iCloud for safe keeping. This also means that your tracking numbers will appear across your iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Mac!\n\nCreate a new entry on your iPhone. Boom - there it is on your iPad, iPod, and Mac! Or vice versa!\n\nWHAT ELSE?\n\n- iPostMaster has a ‘Privacy Mode’, which locks the app until you authentication with Face ID, Touch ID, or your device password\n- Enter the ETA of your delivery so you get a notification on the date you entered\n- You can share all the details of your package so anyone can track your parcels super quickly\n- Regular updates that add new features, couriers, and much much more! iPostMaster is always being updated and improved!\n- and it’s free to download!\n\n\nEXTRAS - Buy Once, Own Forever.\n\nIf you are enjoying iPostMaster and you would like to store more than 5 tracking numbers in the app at one time, you can get an upgrade for a very good price.\n\nThis upgrade allows you to store an unlimited amount of tracking numbers in iPostMaster. Even better than that, once you buy it, you own it forever. No tricks. No subscriptions. No hidden costs. Just a one-off payment.\n\nFINALLY\n\nI have loved building this app for everyone, and I really hope you enjoy using it as much as I have loved building it for you. I really hope it helps you in your daily life.\n\niPostMaster - Designed with Love in LDN.",

			"description": "Liposome Suite is a Mac application that helps in preparation and parameterization of complex lipid systems. App includes database to store lipids molar masses and formulations, comprising of various lipid solutions.\n \nConcentrations (molarity and mg/ml), components moles, final solution volume etc. are calculated based upon initial data provided, such as: initial concentrations of the stock solutions, initial volumes and desired molar ratios.\n \nThe Calculator follows the common liposome preparation procedure, discussed at www.volard.wordpress.com:\n        \n· Stock solutions of lipids (or any other compound) are mixed in appropriate molar ratios.\n· Obtained mixture is purged with nitrogen and organic solvent is finally evacuated under vacuum.\n· Obtained lipid mixture is hydrated and extruded or sonicated, according to the needs.\n \n \nCalculator features:\n  \nApplication is fully interactive: calculations initiated by ► button are sensitive to the recently updated data. For example: final molar concentration and lipid molar fractions (%) of the components can be adjusted at any time if molar concentrations of starting solutions and final suspension volume are provided. Upon any of the aforementioned changes, the application will calculate the volumes of the initial solutions to match the desired final parameters. \n \nIf molecular weights (Mw, \"g/mole\") of solutes (lipids) are provided, then concentrations in the units of grams of solute per liter of solution (\"g/l\" equivalent to \"mg/ml\") can be used and calculated.\n \nIf lipid name exists in database, then application will suggest to autocomplete name and fill in molar mass field, as the name is typed.\n \nOnce calculations are accomplished, the final lipid (and not only) formulation can be stored for future needs, by providing formulation name and pressing “¯” button. To restore formulation data back to calculator, specific entry should be selected and “­” button should be pressed.\n \nTo save lipid molar mass data to the database, the fields for lipid name and molar mass should be filled in, followed by pressing “V” button.\n \nThe lipid molar mass entries can be edited by double clicking the specific entry and editing the value in molar mass field and the pressing the “V” button.\n \nThe formulation entry and lipid entry can be removed by selecting the specific entry and pressing the corresponding “X” button.\n \n \nImportant points:\n \nThe user should follow the simple rule to ensure proper functionality: all known data should be provided in the following order: solution or solute name (optional) -> Mw (if needed) -> initial concentrations (must!) -> volumes (if known) -> molar ratios (if known) -> Total Molarity (if known) -> Total Volume (if known).\n \nSum of stock solution volumes doesn't have to be equal to final suspension volume (Refer to the procedure)!\n \nWatch the molar ratios to ensure that all starting components are included! Program will skip components for which insufficient data is provided! Thus, for example concentration in g/l cannot be included in calculations if Mw of solute is not provided.\n \nIf user updates molar ratios (percents only), program will not start calculations until sum of the ratios will be 100 exactly and obviously, not before than initial concentrations are provided.\n \nTotal Concentration in \"g/l\" and Total Moles fields are for output only.\n \nPlease use \"Done\" button in keyboard or \"Enter\" button to let application know that data is ready. Application is not sensitive to an unconfirmed input for a good reason.\n \nApplication assigns dot as a decimal separator.\n\nLiposome Analysis:\n\nThe window is divided into data panel (left) and results panel (right).\n \nThe data parameters:\nLipid concentration, solution volume, liposome outer diameter,\nbilayer Thickness and molecular Area\n\nThe results parameters:\nAverage number of lipid molecules in a single liposome, \nTotal number of liposomes in the analyzed solution, Inner Volume, Surface Area, Encapsulation",
