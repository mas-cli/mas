Working with iMacs, MacBook Pros, MacBook Air, Mac Minis or Mac Pros. The 3.x series of Connect my tablet is a very efficient expert system - based on more than 2 years of experience of connecting older Wacom tablets, that now are unsupported. Step by step instructions lead you to connection; extensive troubleshooting helps you should not all be going as well as planned- and if all fails - just contact us for help at enquiry@wptrnpt.co.uk! \nConnect my tablet will save your money, enables you to work with the tablet that you are used to, saves a bit of waste and therefore our planet, and - in these times - makes working from home more efficient.\nV3.0: We further simplified instructions to connect older Wacom tablets with newer macOS versions. We also adapted instructions to the latest security updates and updated some driver recommendations. Most importantly, we included for Cintiq (21 upwards) and Intuos3 users instructions as to how to change tablet button settings as well in Catalina. Finally we found and fixed a bug in our last release. Please read the App Description for more information.",

			"description": "Connect my tablet is doing exactly that: It connects your Wacom (TM) tablet to your Mac and restores at least its critical functionality to be creative with Photoshop (TM) and other programmes in Catalina, Mojave, HighSierra, Sierra and El Capitan. For many models and macOS versions, the Wacom preference pane, and therefore previous functionality, will be working again. For others, Connect my tablet provides a tool to let you change the most important pen and tablet settings.\n\nIn Catalina, as in the latest macOS versions, the pen functions and pen buttons work perfectly for all listed tablet types,  as well as most setting options for those pen buttons - after using Connect my tablet. And now Connect my tablet also allows the change of settings of the tablet buttons for Cintiq (21 upwards) and Intuos3 tablet users. In addition, we offer (upon contact)  an additional tool for Bamboo CTH users to change their tablet button settings (beta version).  That leaves very few tablets, where pen and most important functions are already restored, but tablet buttons cannot yet be programmed – but we keep working on it.\nIf your preference pane stopped already working in earlier macOS versions, you can continue to use Connect my tablet to change your pen and some tablet settings.\nAlso for the oldest tablets, the Utility programme from Wacom is no longer supported in Catalina. It was mainly useful to create backups of the preference settings. Our additional utility tool (available upon request and in beta version stage) allows you now to save and restore them.\n\nAs you might have to install and de-install tablet drivers, you will have to have full admin rights on your computer.\n\nWith version 3.x you now get an expert system, guiding you step by step through the reconnection process - or, if needed - the change of settings.\n\nCurrently Connect my tablet supports and is tested on:\nBamboo: including CTH-460/461/470/661/670, CTL 460/470, MTE-450, CTE-450/650 , CTF-430\nIntuos: including USB GD and XD series (0 and 2 series); Intuos3 PTZ-430/431/630/631/930/1231W; CTH-series and many Intuos4 (e.g. PTK) and Intuos5 tablets (e.g. PTH)\nGraphire: 2,3 (Sapphire) and 4 series\nCintiq: including 18SX, 20WSX, 21UX, 13HD, DTU-2231 and others\nBut it works for many more tablets and you can always ask us at enquiry@wptrnpt.co.uk\n\nCurrent capabilities for those tablets that not only need reconnection (and then their preference pane works again) but also require settings to be changed via Connect my tablet:\n\n• Tablet/ Stylus connected\n• One group of settings for all applications (although with different backups you can be application specific)\n• Pen Pressure Sensitivity selectable\n• Pen Buttons programmable (keystrokes, modifiers, clicks)\n• Eraser programmable\n• Double click assistance can be switched off/on\n• Definition of the active tablet area\n• Definition of the active monitor (currently for up to 3 monitors)\n• Definition of the pen/stylus to switch to mouse mode from pen mode\n• Change of tablet landscape orientations or to portrait mode (some tablets)\n• Pan (Pan/Scroll) mode for pen buttons (for most tablets)\n• Definition of tablet buttons (Intuos3, Cintiq 21UX upwards via Connect my tablet, Bamboo CTH via an additional tool) NEW\n\nWe may add further settings for change if required and feasible. Again, just contact us at: enquiry@wptrnpt.co.uk",

			"description": "Create your own dynamic desktop wallpaper (time-shifting/solar-shifting) on macOS Mojave & Catalina.\n\nDynaper makes it easy to create a native time/solar-shifting HEIC wallpaper that changes throughout the day. Wallpapers made by Dynaper are supported by macOS Mojave & Catalina and can be set as wallpaper in System Preferences.\n\nSimply drag&drop your images and change the display time for each image. Dynaper will change time automatically if image contains EXIF metadata or contains time suffix in the filename. For a quick time change use the autosuggest feature. For solar-shifting wallpaper run Solar Wizard where you can export it.\n\nDragging image out of Dynaper will create time-shifting text that contains normalized time and parameters that one can use for manual HEIC creation.  \n\nHelper tools:\n- time helper (convert time to normalized time)\n- solar helper (convert location to solar data: altitude and azimuth)\n- solar wizard (convert many locations to solar data: altitude and azimuth)\n- HEIC metadata (view HEIC metadata used for wallpaper display)\n- strip still images helper (removes Dark/Light appearance metadata from dynamic image)\n\nSolar Wizard is accessible from top menu (Utilities-> Solar Wizard).\n\nAutomatic Time Detector:\nTo save your time Dynaper automatically recognises timestamps in your filename or metadata. If your filename doesn't have valid time Dynaper will look at EXIF metadata (date of creation) to find valid time. Just append your filename with suffix HH_mm, where H is hour and m is minute. 24 hour format is being used for detection and last 5 character of filename are being checked. \n\nExample of valid filenames:\nimage001_16_45.jpg\nimage001_16_45\nscreenshot_16.45.05.jpg\nscreenshot_16.45.05\n\nWide-gamut colors:\nWide-gamut color devices display more vivid and lifelike hues. This is important as all of the recent Apple devices can display these colors so it's best if you provide pictures that have been captured with wide-gamut colors. Whether you provide images with sRGB color profile or P3 display color profile, Dynaper will automatically choose the best color profile for you. Mind that dynamic wallpapers created on web don't support wide-gamut colors. \n\nStill images:\nDynaper has ability to export dynamic wallpaper with still dark image and still light image. Right click in table view to select light/dark image or select still images during export. Since macOS Catalina the system will prefer dark still image on dark appearance. User must enable this feature (add still images) in preferences.\n\nPlease note that exported HEIC images include watermark. Removing the watermark is possible with in-app purchase.\n\nExample of image display time:\n1.  00:05AM-01:00AM (for time 00:05)\n\u20282. 01:00AM-03:00AM (for time 01:00)\n\u20283. 03:00AM-04:00AM\u2028 (for time 03:00)\n4. 04:00AM-00:05AM (for time 04:00)",
