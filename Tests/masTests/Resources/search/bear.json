			"description": "Allegory is a powerful notes app with a beautiful iOS-centric UI. The minimal and focused writing experience, combined with an impressive set of powerful features, makes this the ideal choice for everyone. Allegory removes the complexity of most markdown editors, presenting a minimal UI that’s welcoming for casual writers and note-takers as well as more attuned authors, making it a great app for you to pick up regardless of your background and skill level.\n\n—\n\nWHY YOU'LL LOVE ALLEGORY:\n\nAllegory immediately launches to the clean and simple note editor screen, boosting your productivity and reducing friction between wanting to write down what you’ve just thought of, and actually getting it written down. Support for valid markdown as well as custom markdown makes it easier to create your best work.\n\nAllegory also includes a brilliant hand-crafted drawing area which lets you select from a variety of colors, long-holding on any of the tools brings them into focus with sliders to adjust their opacity and stroke size with gorgeous animations that strike awe.\n\nYou can bookmark and set due dates on any note from anywhere in the app regardless of where you are, which makes performing essential actions entirely seamless, further reducing friction for users. Seamless iCloud sync adds upon the notion of keeping your notes exactly where they need to be. Notes can be searched for within the app in ways that make sense to you, by words and dates, or by using language that comes naturally such as ‘today’, ‘yesterday’, and ‘last week’. A summary of your current note also provides further context on your writing by displaying character/word/line/paragraph counts, sentiment analysis to portray how positive or negative your writing is, quick links to open the specific note, and more.\n\nInspiration can strike anywhere, and that is why Allegory supports custom action extensions that allow creating notes and putting down ideas from other apps. You can also use Siri to do the same. Scan documents and text to convert it to notes, or add images within notes to provide more context. When you want to share your work with the world, use one of the many export options to create files that work best for you, from TXT and MD, to HTML and PDF. Or simply export as an image or plain text. It's built in ways that make sense to your workflow.\n\nTweak and adjust the app to make it look and behave the way that you want. From app icons and tints, to markdown settings and haptics, there's a settings option to make the app your own. URL schemes and Siri shortcuts allow you to perform useful actions in Allegory from anywhere. Allegory is available on your iPhone, your iPad, and your Apple Watch, and supports seamless iCloud sync to share notes without lifting a finger.\n\nAll the power of iOS is in your hands with Allegory. It is fully integrated with the latest technologies such as Dark Mode, a standalone Apple Watch app, Siri, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Context Menus, iCloud sync, Notifications, document scanning, biometric locks, custom haptics, Pencil support, keyboard shortcuts, URL schemes, custom app icons, iMessage stickers, fully accessible, and more.\n\n—\n\nGET IN TOUCH:\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please get in touch. Allegory was created by an incredibly small team of one and I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm available through email shihab@allegoryapp.info or Twitter @AllegoryApp or @JPEGuin.\n\nhttps://www.allegoryapp.info/terms\nhttps://www.allegoryapp.info/privacy",

Grizzly Adventure is Jadeware's first and most famous platform game complete with over 30 action-packed levels. An evil sorcerer has taken control of Grizzly's forest and driven the creatures completely mad. With the animals under control and the help of a few minions, the sorcerer plans to bring the forest down, but Grizzly's not gonna take it in these woods. Follow Grizzly on his journey through 3 different worlds as he takes on enemies that are out to get him! Goblins, trolls and killer bees will be only some of the many obstacles that will come his way as he tries to reach his quest. Thankfully, mother nature is on his side, and Grizzly can count on a strong ally for food and hidden passageways to trick the beasts. Complete with a groovy soundtrack and some eye-catching graphics, Grizzly is surely the game you have been waiting for to get back to some platform fun!\n\n30 levels of fun + Bonus\n- Forest\n- Green Hill\n- Mines",

			"description": "• Winner of a 2013 PARENTS’ CHOICE Gold Honor Award\n• An interactive animated storybook originally published by the award-winning Living Books\n• A tale of taking charge of one's imagination, especially when it makes you afraid of the dark\n• Educational Volume Discount now available\n\nReview:\n\"Parents for two generations are familiar with the late Stan and Jan Berenstain's Bears and their over 200 books. Wanderful enlivens those classic stories, creating a rich resource for developing reading skills in an animated interactive app.  Our child testers laughed at comic elements and groaned at others, such as a dancing book piping in to say \"Hey! Check me out!\" All ages intuitively grasped navigation of the app, although teacher/parent familiarization with the content rich resource options and customizable settings will go a long way toward optimizing skill development and individualized interface.\n\nAll words are \"active\" in the 'Let Me Play\" mode so a child can tap on an individual word which is then highlighted and pronounced. We had fun making silly sentences with chosen words and word recognition was mastered in child-driven play.\n  \nWanderful offers a superb level of interaction with a well-designed app loaded with varying levels of skill development and simple fun appropriate for eager 2 year olds up to age 8.\"\n\n- Parents' Choice   ©2013 Parents' Choice \n\nHave you ever wished you could play inside a story and really interact with all the characters and words? Now you can! The Berenstain Bears In the Dark is an imaginative interactive reading experience with fully animated content featuring the popular Bear Family - Mama Bear, Papa Bear, Brother Bear, and Sister Bear.\n\nThis timeless Stan and Jan Berenstain story springs to life on every page. Read and play along as a spooky story Brother Bear reads to Sister Bear keeps her - and eventually the entire family - up all night long. The next day Papa shows Sister how to take charge of her imagination and in the end it's Brother who is a little afraid in the dark. \n\nKEY FEATURES:\n• App and all story content is in English \n• 12 fully animated pages\n• Virtually every item on each page comes to life when clicked\n• All words are \"active\" for extended word play and language learning - click on any word to hear it spoken\n• A hidden surprise is on each page - can you find all the lightning bugs?\n• Move between pages with the new scrolling page navigation\n• Two modes: \"Read to Me\" and the fully interactive \"Let Me Play\"\n• Multiple settings to further customize the App for your child's reading experience\n• Special \"About the Authors\" video profiling Jan and Stan Berenstain available from within the App\n• Parental tips to help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook\n• Teacher resources include a 32 page overview of Wanderful interactive storybooks Classroom Activities and the full 65 page In The Dark Classroom Activities guide (English)\n\nWanderful's goal is to help children discover a lasting love of language through story exploration. We hope The Berenstain Bears In The Dark provides your family, children and students with hours of delightful story play. \n\nThe Berenstain Bears In The Dark is by Stan and Jan Berenstain, authors of over 200 books starring the Bear family: Mama, Papa, Brother and Sister.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure\nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.  This app:\n• does not collect any information\n• does not contain ads\n• does not contain in-app purchases, but has links to other Wanderful Apps\n• includes active links to websites or social networks, but ONLY from the PARENTS and TEACHERS pages, not from the storybook pages",
