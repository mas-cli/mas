			"description": "Talon is a simple tool for users to use, manage, and work with Webhooks on Discord and Slack. It's very easy to use, and allows a larger audience to work with Webhooks in a simple way, without requiring you to know how to code. Talon gets rid of everything complex, and gives you a nice and easy to use Interface thats familiar to use. We built Talon to take advantage of the features that Discord and Slack offer. Talon allows you to save and copy your links inside of the app, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth just to use the App. Also with Talon, you can run POST Requests to any service, just in case Talon does not yet offer something you have in mind.\n\nFor even more features, you can purchase Talon Pro. Talon Pro is a one time purchase that allows you to shorten links with Talon - and gives you more customizability. Talon Pro will be growing more with future updates.\n\nWant to suggest something for a future Talon update? Contact us!\n\nNow, that sounds pretty cool and all - but this is just the beginning. Stay tuned for future updates that'll bring more features and functionality to Talon!",

At the start of the game, the player is placed on the surface of a procedurally generated and virtually infinite game world. The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields.Players can walk across the terrain consisting of plains, mountains, forests, caves, and various water bodies.\n\n   The core gameplay revolves around breaking and placing blocks. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes—arranged in a fixed grid pattern and representing different materials, such as dirt, stone, various ores, water, lava, tree trunks, etc. While players can move freely across the world, objects can only be placed at fixed locations on the grid. Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere, thus allowing for various constructions.",

			"description": "Do you work smart, not hard? Well that's great, but your boss and team mates might be forming opinions based on whether you show up as active or available or online on your office's instant messaging tools like Slack, Skype, Microsoft Teams and more. \n\nOnce you stay idle for some time, these messaging tools display your status as away or idle or offline causing your co-workers to suspect you are not in front of your computer all the time. You know how big a problem this is if you WFH (work from home) regularly and can't constantly be in front of your computer.\n\nSlacker solves this by moving your mouse pointer for you whenever you are idle - the result is that you always show as active on any corporate/office instant messaging tools (like Slack or Microsoft Teams) running on your work computer.\n\nThis additionally also means that your screen lock and screensaver will not be activated and your system will not go to sleep just because you step away from your computer while working from home or in the office.",

			"description": "Ever been in a video call and needed to turn off your microphone, but couldn’t find the mute button quickly enough?\n\nMic Drop helps you mute (and then unmute!) your microphone with a keyboard shortcut or a menu bar control. It works with every meeting app out there—from Zoom to Slack, FaceTime to Houseparty.\n\nIt also shows your mic status in a menu bar icon, so you'll always know at a glance whether you're muted or not. And it lets you (un)mute yourself even if you don't have your meeting app open.\n\nMic Drop:\n\n- Allows you to define a custom keyboard shortcut that works across your Mac.\n- Works with every app and audio device out there.\n- Automatically keeps you muted (or unmuted!) if you change audio devices.\n- Supports push-to-talk and push-to-mute.\n- Shows your microphone status in the menu bar.\n- Shows your microphone status in an optional floating window.\n- Respects your privacy. Mic Drop never listens to you.\n\nBecause Mic Drop mutes your audio at the system level, it works with any app you can imagine. We’ve tested with:\n\n- Zoom\n- Slack\n- Google Meet\n- Skype\n- Microsoft Teams\n- Discord\n- FaceTime\n- Vidyo\n- Houseparty\n- Cisco Webex\n- and many more.\n\nIt just works. No matter where you’re meeting, Mic Drop’s got you covered.\n\n----------\n\nA note on hardware compatibility:\n\nMic Drop works with just about any audio device out there, but some audio devices can't be muted by macOS, so Mic Drop can't control them. All bluetooth and wired headphones work—it's just some niche USB audio interfaces that Mic Drop won't mute. Mic Drop will warn you if it detects an incompatible device. A list of problematic devices are listed on our support page.",

Because ChannelScrobbler reads your Last.fm feed scrobbles from your account it will catch new songs from any device that supports scrobbling, not just your computer!\n\n* Includes retina graphics and support for dark status bars!\n* Scrobbles are posted by a bot with customizable name, avatar, and colors.\n\nIf you're having problems using ChannelScrobbler, please email edelabar@gmail.com for support.",

			"description": "Monitro is a macOS menu bar app that monitors folders for changes and can also provide simple IMAP mail processing as well.\n\nFor folders you create a list of folders you wish to have monitored. You can select details such as search depth and whether or not aliases should be followed. You can then apply a wide variety of timers to do the comparisons for changes ranging from every minute to something like weekly on Thursday at 2:30 PM. When changes are detected you can send a change report to combination of email addresses, a Slack web hook, or log file. Change detections are based on comparing to a database of file names, created dates, and modified dates. Using a database is important since you can actually quit the app and launch it any time in the future and it will report on any changes since it last saw the folders being monitored at the next reporting times.\n\nFor IMAP email processing you can apply simple rules to any email accounts you want to be monitored. You can query on To, From, CC, BCC, Subject, Body, Has Attachment, Attachment Name, Attachment Type, and for PDF or text files look at text within the attachment itself. When an email is matched you can apply actions on it such as Move, Copy, Delete, Mark Read, Mark Flagged, Mark Answered, or Save Attachments. It is important to note that you can actually Move or Copy messages between completely different IMAP accounts you have defined for access. It is usually very difficult to find these features server side and though some are possible client side with Monitro you do not need to have an email client running 24/7 to provide this level of filtering.\n\nMonitro is FREE for one Folder Monitor and one IMAP Monitor Rule. If you need more than that you can purchase a yearly subscription for $12.99 to unlock Full Access mode which let you run an unlimited number of monitors for folders or rules for IMAP accounts. If $12.99 seems high remember this is a very specific use app that is intended to unlock more time if your life if you find its features useful. It is not expected to attract a large paid user base. However, if the user base proves large enough the targeted use of funds is further feature development based on user feedback.\n\nMonitro is made for Mojave will not work on earlier versions of macOS.   Unless you are saving attachments from IMAP accounts the only writing to your file system Monitro will do is to its own private settings and databases. It will not touch or otherwise store any information in the folders you monitor thus it is possible to have more than one monitor for a single folder and still have things work flawlessly. Monitro is made to play well as a sandboxed app but if you are looking to monitor folders applications normally do not have access to you will need to enable Full Disk Access on your own.\n\nHINT: For IMAP Rules saving attachments Monitro pairs perfectly with Haze from Noodlesoft. Hazel is an app from an unrelated developer that watches whatever folders you tell it to, automatically organizing your files according to the rules you create.",

			"description": "World of Mines is a classic, throwback PC game with a World Map twist. \nInspired by the original game written for many computing platforms since the 1960s. \n\nCOGOO INITIATIVE\nTeam Cogoo has created World of Mines as a small and humble campaign to help promote 2025 Completion Challenge and to raise awareness in our community. Whether you have 10 minutes, one hour, or plenty of time, you can help build  a world free of land mines and promote the rights of landmine victims too! \n\nTHE WORLD IS STILL IN DANGER OF LANDMINES\nThe use of land mine is controversial because of their potential as indiscriminate weapons. They can remain dangerous many years after a conflict has ended, harming civilians and the economy. 78 countries are contaminated with land mines and 15000+ people are killed every year. Approximately 80% of land mine casualties are civilian, with children as the most affected age group. Most Killings occur in times of peace. \n\nIf you like old classic games such as chess, checkers, backgammon, solitaire, freecell as well as classic puzzle games like sudoku, tetris and crossword puzzles then this game is for you!\n\nGAME PLAY\n-Save the world from landmines by finding bombs\n-Easy to control \n-Best, smoothest, fastest interface of any Mines game\n-First tap luck\n-Flag Mode: Turn on flag mode to mark tiles you think are bombs quickly\n-177 Countries for hours of fun. (Countries and number of bombs don’t necessarily have a meaning)\n-Variety of map sizes and shapes\n\nHOW TO PLAY\nThe objective of the game is to clear a country map containing hidden “mines” or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number or neighboring mines in each field. The player is initially presented with a world map. The Player can select and choose to play a specific country by touching the country on the map. The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by touching each square. If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contains mines. If no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed. The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine. \n\nIf you love the game and care to provide feedback, please join our Facebook group and share you thoughts on future improvements.",
