        "description": "Get things done! The award-winning Things app helps you plan your day, manage your projects, and make real progress toward your goals.\n\nBest of all, it’s easy to use. Within the hour, you’ll have everything off your mind and neatly organized—from routine tasks to your biggest life goals—and you can start focusing on what matters today.\n\n“Things offers the best combination of design and functionality of any app we tested, with nearly all the features of other power user applications and a delightful interface that never gets in the way of your work.”\n—Wirecutter, The New York Times\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Your To-Dos\nYour basic building block is the almighty To-Do—each a small step toward a great accomplishment. You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features. Here are just a few:\n\n• Reminders — set a time and Things will remind you.\n• Repeaters — automatically repeat to-dos on a schedule you set.\n• This Evening — a special place for your evening plans.\n• Calendar integration — see your events and to-dos together.\n• Tags — categorize your to-dos and quickly filter lists.\n• Quick Entry — create to-dos from anywhere, as soon as the thought hits you.\n• Quick Find — instantly locate to-dos, headings, or tags.\n• Type Travel — jump from list to list with your keyboard; just start typing!\n• Mail to Things — forward an email to Things; now it’s a to-do.\n• And much more!\n\n\nMADE FOR MAC\n\nThings is tailored to the Mac with deep system integrations as well. A great example is Quick Entry with Autofill: a shortcut that grabs content from other apps and adds it to Things for you, such as a link to a website or an email you want to get back to.\n\nYou can also enjoy a beautiful dark mode at sunset, connect your calendars, enable a Things widget, use your Mac’s Touch Bar, import from Reminders—Things can do it all! There’s even AppleScript support if you need powerful automation.\n\n\nSTAY PRODUCTIVE ON THE GO\n\nThings has full-featured apps for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch as well (sold separately). All your devices sync seamlessly via our free Things Cloud service. It’s great to have everything at your fingertips when you need it!\n\n\nAWARD-WINNING DESIGN\n\nMade in Stuttgart, with two Apple Design Awards to its name, Things is a fine example of German engineering: designed, not only to look fantastic, but to be perfectly functional as well. Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there.

        "description": "easyPlanner is the innovative app that will manage for you the things to do using the tasks and projects and the things you need to remember using memos. You can manage your appointments and tasks on multiple levels (multi-levels) as your mind would! You can also monitor your progress with the Reports and see how productive you are. If you are not happy with what you are producing you can try to increase your productivity by using our FocusTimer, a tool that will allow you to maintain concentration and carry out more tasks simultaneously.\neasyPlanner aims to make your life easier and “to work” in place of your memory. Getting organized means having more free time for you and for those you love, dedicating the time you have saved to create unforgettable moments with the people of your life.\n\nMANAGE THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO AND THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER\u2028\n\nWe provide you tasks, projects and memos management in a single app.\n\nTASKS\n\neasyPlanner allows you to manage the “things you need to do” through our “Tasks”. Each task can contain infinite sub-tasks (multi-tasks) and can be grouped into folders. \n\nPROJECTS\n\nWhen a certain number of tasks are closely related to each other and they concern significant commitments, it is possible to manage them as a single project. Even the project, like the task, can contain infinite sub-tasks (multi-tasks).\n\nMEMOS\n\neasyPlanner allows you to manage the “things you need to remember” both in free format and in a structured format using memos.\n\nMONITOR YOUR REPETITIVE TASKS WITH REPORT\u2028\n\nThe \"Report\" function was born of the need to represent a set of complex data or complex tasks in the form of a table so that they can be printed and read more easily. Thanks to this function you will be able to graphically visualize a set of recurring tasks in a simple way and you will be able to monitor the progress of these tasks daily.\n\n\nINCREASE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY WITH FOCUS TIMER\n\nFocus Timer has been designed after a careful study based on several time management theories. It is a very advanced “time management” system which consists in dividing time into intervals, each of which is characterized by a task that you have to do. This division leads the subjects who use it to be much more efficient, to better manage their time and to constantly develop their mental abilities.\n\nAGENDA\n\u2028Thanks to the Agenda view easyPlanner will allow you to keep track of your schedule and your appointments at any time.\nAgenda will also integrate the Apple calendar. \nYou can add your events in the calendars directly from here in a practical and fast way.\nYou can decide which calendars to see and which to hide.\n\nICLOUD SYNC\n\nWith easyPlanner you can archive your photos, your documents, your tasks, etc. on ICloud and you can synchronize all your devices automatically and simultaneously. Regardless of the device you are using (IPhone or IPad), you will always have the latest version of your documents available.\n\nDELEGATE\n\nDelegate urgent tasks to other people by sharing them by email.\n\nAND SO MUCH MORE…\n\nYou will find out many more features trying our app or going to our website  www.easyLife.biz/easyPlanner.\u2028\nCHOOSE THE VERSION THAT BEST SUITS YOU AND YOUR NEEDS\n\nTry easyPlanner – Task manager for free.\u2028You can use this version without time limits and in all its functions in order to appreciate all its features. However this version only allows 40 entries.\u2028If you start to get tight, upgrade to the easyPlanner – PRO version, available via in-app purchase or as a stand-alone version.\u2028easyPlanner – PRO Version allows you to get an unlimited number of entries, giving you the opportunity to always have everything you need with you and to take advantage of Reports over time. \nOne-time purchase. Without subscription. \n\nIf you have any question, any suggestions or if you want to tell us what you thing of easyPlanner you can contact us:\u2028\n\nwww.easylife.biz\nsupport@easylife.biz\n\nTerms of service: https://www.easylife.biz/terms/",

        "description": "▷ 4.5/5 Stars, Macworld May 2015\n\nRecapture the Lost Art of Joyful Concentration. Overcome Procrastination. Get Motivated.\n\nVitamin-R creates optimal conditions for your brain by structuring your work into short bursts of distraction-free, highly-focused activity alternating with opportunities for renewal, reflection and intuition.\n\nThe built-in task logging and analysis features create positive momentum towards productivity by providing you with visible feedback on your progress and achievements.\n\n▷ Slices Up Daunting Tasks into Manageable Chunks\n\nVitamin-R breaks down large, vaguely defined tasks into a series of short \"time slices\" of between 10 and 30 minutes, each with a specific, easily reachable and actionable objective.\n\n▷ Keeps You Focused\n\nVitamin-R features an array of highly configurable visual, audio and speech notifications that prod you back to your task as soon as your attention starts to wander.\n\n▷ Gets You Started, Keeps You Motivated\n\nVitamin-R allows you to break through the resistance of procrastination and create a positive feedback loop of small achievements that get you closer to your ultimate aims.\n\n▷ Effective Task Switching\n\nTask switching is a big, but often unavoidable productivity killer. Vitamin-R makes it as efficient as possible and the built-in \"breadcrumbing\" technique helps you pick up where you left off.\n\n▷ Productive Breaks\n\nRegular breaks are not for slackers. In fact, they are especially important for people who work with high focus. Vitamin-R's timed breaks make sure that your renewal break does not turn into a free afternoon and the \"priming\" technique allows your intuition to work overtime before you even start on an objective.\n\n▷ Find Your Rhythm\n\nEach one of us is different. Find out what works best for you and unlock the key to true productivity. Vitamin-R provides the tools to gain improved awareness of your preferred work methods and rhythms. Armed with this new knowledge, you can eliminate unproductive work patterns. \n\n▷ Get It Out of Your Head Quickly\n\nDid you know that your short term memory can only hold 4-6 \"chunks\" of information? The slightest interruption and it's all gone and you have to start from scratch. That's why Vitamin-R provides you with the \"Now & Later Board\", complete with FastType magic, to give you a place to quickly dump all those things that go through your head and allow you to quickly return to your task. \n\n▷ Make It Your Own\n\nVitamin-R plugs into your life rather than trying to take it over. You can use it occasionally to overcome procrastination or mental blocks or re-organize your entire working life around the concepts that it embodies.\n\n▷ Works with OmniFocus, Things & The Hit List\n\nVitamin-R integrates with traditional to-do list managers rather than trying to replace them. \n\n▷ Block Out Noise\n\nThe built-in noise machine can block out irritating coworkers and create energizing soundscapes.\n\n▷ Syncs with all your Mac OS X and iOS Devices\n\nVitamin-R for Mac seamlessly syncs with the iPhone version and multiple Macs via its simple Dropbox integration, so you can log your time slices wherever you are.\n\n▷ Ideal for Pomodoro Technique Aficionados\n\nVitamin-R provides everything you need to implement the Pomodoro Technique: sophisticated timer, log book and analysis component.\n\n▷ Attention Deficit Disorder\n\nWhile Vitamin-R was never specifically designed with ADHD \"sufferers\" in mind, many ADHD-ers have found its approach to focusing attention invaluable.",

You can manage your appointments and tasks on multiple levels (multi-levels) as your mind would! You can also monitor your progress with the Reports and see how productive you are. If you are not happy with what you are producing you can try to increase your productivity by using our FocusTimer, a tool that will allow you to maintain concentration and carry out more tasks simultaneously.\neasyPlanner aims to make your life easier and “to work” in place of your memory. Getting organized means having more free time for you and for those you love, dedicating the time you have saved to create unforgettable moments with the people of your life.\n\nMANAGE THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO AND THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER\u2028\n\nWe provide you tasks, projects and memos management in a single app.\n\nTASKS\n\neasyPlanner allows you to manage the “things you need to do” through our “Tasks”. Each task can contain infinite sub-tasks (multi-tasks) and can be grouped into folders. \n\nPROJECTS\n\nWhen a certain number of tasks are closely related to each other and they concern significant commitments, it is possible to manage them as a single project. Even the project, like the task, can contain infinite sub-tasks (multi-tasks).\n\nMEMOS\n\neasyPlanner allows you to manage the “things you need to remember” both in free format and in a structured format using memos.\n\nMONITOR YOUR REPETITIVE TASKS WITH REPORT\u2028\n\nThe \"Report\" function was born of the need to represent a set of complex data or complex tasks in the form of a table so that they can be printed and read more easily. Thanks to this function you will be able to graphically visualize a set of recurring tasks in a simple way and you will be able to monitor the progress of these tasks daily.\n\n\nINCREASE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY WITH FOCUS TIMER\n\nFocus Timer has been designed after a careful study based on several time management theories.

        "description": "OmniFocus 3 Enterprise simplifies deployment for customers who wish to pay full-price for the Pro edition up front. For most customers, we recommend our normal edition — which uses in-app purchases to support free two-week trials, two levels of functionality (Standard and Pro), and upgrade discounts. The list price and the functionality of OmniFocus Pro are the same in both apps.\n\nUse OmniFocus to accomplish more every day. Create projects and tasks, organize them with tags, focus on what you can do right now — and get stuff done.\n\nOmniFocus — now celebrating 10 years as the trusted, gold-standard to-do list app — brings unrivaled power and flexibility to your Mac, making it easy to work the way you want to work.\n\nOmniFocus manages everything in your busy life. Use projects to organize tasks naturally, and then add tags to organize across projects. Easily enter tasks when you’re on the go, and process them when you have time. Tap the Forecast view — which shows both tasks and calendar events — to get a handle on your day. Use the Review perspective to keep your projects and tasks on track.\n\nThen let our free syncing system make sure your data is the same on every Mac. (And on OmniFocus for iOS and Web, available separately.) Because your data is encrypted, it’s safe in the cloud.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• NEW: Tags add a powerful additional organizing tool. Create tags for people, energy levels, priorities, locations, and more.\n• NEW: The Forecast view shows your tasks and calendar events in order, so you can better see what’s coming up in your day.\n• NEW: Enhanced repeating tasks are easier than ever to set up — and they work with real-world examples such as the first weekday of the month.\n• NEW: The Modern, fresh-but-familiar design helps you focus on your content.\n• NEW: Today’s Forecast can include items with a specific tag, and you can reorder those tasks however you choose, so you can plan your day better.\n• Inbox is where you quickly add tasks — save them when you think of them, and organize them later.\n• Syncing supports end-to-end encryption so that your data is safe wherever it’s stored, on our server or yours.\n• Notes can be attached to your tasks, so you have all the information you need.\n• Attachments — graphics, video, audio, whatever you want — add richness to your tasks.\n• View Options let you customize each perspective by deciding what it should show and how it should filter your tasks.\n• The Review perspective takes you through your projects and tasks — so you stay on track.\n• Custom perspectives help you create new ways to see your data by filtering and grouping projects and tags. NEW: The filtering rules are simpler to use while being more powerful than ever, letting you combine rules with “all,” “any,” and “none.” You can also choose any image to use as your custom perspective’s icon, and a custom tint color to go with it.\n• OmniFocus Mail Drop adds tasks via email and works with services like IFTTT and Zapier (if you’re using our free syncing server).\n• The Today Widget shows you your most important items — you don’t even have to switch to the app to know what’s up.\n• Support for TaskPaper Text and omnifocus:///add and /paste lets you automate using URLs.\n• The customizable sidebar lets you organize your perspectives the way you want to, for super-fast access.\n• The Today Widget shows a perspective of your choice in Notification Center.\n• AppleScript support opens up a world of automation, using Apple’s Mac scripting language.\n\nThe app includes a manual, and there’s plenty more documentation on the website.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nIf you have feedback or questions, our Support Humans would love to hear from you! Send email to omnifocus@omnigroup.com, call us at at 1-800-315-6664 or +1-206-523-4152, or reach us on Twitter at @omnifocus.",
