        # Console command & output formatting

        When providing commands & output, please use the following format (where `…` is a placeholder):

        - Use a multiline console block: start with ```` ```console ````, end with ```` ``` ````, each on its own line
        - Prefix each non-console step (or comment) with two hashes & a space: `## …`
        - Remove shell prompts; instead, prefix each console command with a dollar sign & a space: `$ …`
        - Prefix each output line beginning with `#`, `$`, `%`, or `>` with an additional instance of that <!--
          --> character: `##…`, `$$…`, `%%…`, or `>>…`
        - Write all other output lines without any prefix: `…`

        e.g.:

        ````text
        ```console
        ## In the Mac App Store GUI, …
        $ mas list
        123  App 1  (4.5.6)
        124  App 2  (10.2)
        ```
        ````
