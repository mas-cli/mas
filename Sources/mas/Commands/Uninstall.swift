extension MAS {
	/// Uninstalls apps installed from the Mac App Store by App ID.
	///
	/// This command removes apps previously installed via `mas install`,
	/// identified by their App Store ID. It uses macOS’s Finder infrastructure
	/// to safely move the app to the Trash.
	///
	/// > Important:
	/// > You must run this command with root privileges (via `sudo`).
	///
	/// > Tip:
	/// > Use `--dry-run` to preview which apps would be removed, without deleting anything.
	///
	/// Example:
	/// ```bash
	/// sudo mas uninstall 497799835
	/// ```
	///
	/// Dry run:
	/// ```bash
	/// mas uninstall 497799835 --dry-run
	/// ```
	///
	/// > Note:
	/// > This command only affects apps listed by `mas list`.
	/// 
	/// > Important:
	/// > This command relies on macOS Spotlight indexing to detect installed apps.
	/// > If some apps do not appear as expected, you may need to rebuild the metadata index:
	/// > ```bash
	/// > sudo mdutil -Eai on
	/// > ```
	/// > For details, see the [README Troubleshooting Section](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas#troubleshooting).
