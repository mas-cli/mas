# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/new) to simply ask a question or request a new feature.
- Search for similar issues with the
[ERROR MESSAGE](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+ERROR+MESSAGE)
you are experiencing.
- If one doesn't exist, [open a new issue](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/new)
  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - Include the earliest version of `mas` that you know has the issue.
  - Include your macOS version.

## Making Changes

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas#fork-destination-box) on GitHub.
- Clone your fork
  `git clone git@github.com:your-username/mas.git`
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  - This is usually the `main` branch.
  - To quickly create a topic branch based on `main`, run
     `git checkout -b awesome-feature main`
  - Please avoid working [directly on the main branch](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/223400/when-should-i-stop-committing-to-master-on-new-projects).
  - Make commits of logical units.
- Run script/format before committing your changes. Fix anything that isn't automatically fixed by the linters.
- Push your topic branch to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/compare/main...your-username:topic-branch).

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Write tests. (Tests target is still [in progress](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/123))
  - If you need help with tests, feel free to open a PR in the meantime and just ask for some help.
  - Add "[WIP]" to the title of your PR to indicate that it's not ready to be merged.
- Follow our [style guide](docs/style.md).
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
  - Including [appropriate emoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) in the first line of commit messages is fun :wink:.

## Becoming a Contributor

team to help with the issue/PR backlog and even release new versions of this project,
[open a new issue](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/new)
titled "Add Contributor: @YourGitHubUsername", with a brief message asking to join the team.

## Branching and Releases

- This project follows [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), where `main` is our trunk.
- Release commits will be tagged in the format: `v1.2.3`.
- Once releases are tagged, high-level release notes are published on the
[releases](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/releases) page.
